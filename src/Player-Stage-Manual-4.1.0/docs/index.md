5th Edition

Using Player 3.0.2 and Stage 4.1.1 (latest stable versions)

A user manual for the Player/Stage robot simulator.

This document is intended as a guide for anyone learning Player/Stage for the
first time. It explains the process of setting up a new simulation
environment and how to then make your simulation do something, using a case
study along the way. Whilst it is aimed at Player/Stage users, those just wishing
to use Player on their robot may also find sections of this document useful
(particularly the parts about coding with Player).

If you have any questions about using Player/Stage there is a guide to getting
help from the Player community at
[http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/wiki/Getting_help](http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/wiki/Getting_help)

This edition of the manual uses Stage version 4.1.1.  As there are
significant differences with the previous versions of Stage and the
previous edition of this manual is now out of date. They are available at
